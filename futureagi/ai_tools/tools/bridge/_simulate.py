"""Bridge registration for simulation detail APIViews.

Surfaces the FULL existing DRF responses through the bridge instead of
hand-written tools, so MCP and the UI share one source of truth:

- get_call_execution -> CallExecutionDetailView: full call detail including
  turn/latency/WPM/talk-ratio/interruption analytics (TH-5397).
- get_scenario -> ScenarioDetailView: full scenario detail including the
  scenario graph (nodes/edges) (TH-5375).

# Detail GET handlers take the id as a named URL kwarg (call_execution_id /

# Use the "retrieve" action: it's a DETAIL action (so the bridge builds an `id`
# input param and routes it), and for an APIView it resolves to the `.get()`
# handler. pk_kwarg names the handler's URL kwarg (call_execution_id /
# scenario_id) so the id reaches `get(request, <kwarg>=id)`.
